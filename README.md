# illegal-activity-detection-system

The proposed system uses face-detection and identification technology. The aim of the creation of this project is to automatically detect criminals and their illegal activities using face and gesture detection technology. We can easily detect weapons such as guns and knives using the above system. The above security system is developed for the safety of the general public and security personnel because checking physically for weapons can be dangerous for the security personnel also so it’s just a try from our side to save the lives of security personnel also. The inspiration of developing the above systems came from a Hollywood movie.

# Overview

In the current scenario of technology face-detection systems are replacing human physical security checking. The systems nowadays are trained to such an extent that they can easily recognize any weapon or illegal objects. Facial recognition will be helpful in dealing with the criminal from a very far distance for example if we can detect how many guns a criminal is carrying then the armed forces can plan the proper attack and defense strategy accordingly. And this will lead to low human resource damage of the armed forces.

# Introduction and Background

The above-proposed system uses face-detection and identification technology. The aim of the creation of this project is to automatically detect criminals and their illegal activities using face and gesture detection technology. We can easily detect weapons such as guns and knives using the above system. The above security system is developed for the safety of the general public and security personnel because checking physically for weapons can be dangerous for the security personnel also so it’s just a try from our side to save the lives of security personnel also.

# Problem Description:

Detection of criminal activities through CCTV by analyzing live footage of melee, mob formation, body language of suspect etc. Most of the time it became difficult for the forces to evacuate and to fight with terrorists because they didn't have the proper info about the type and number of weapons the rebels were carrying.
Nowadays maximum people use CCTV cameras to monitor the environment if in case some criminal passes by in the frame of the CCTV footage it is not mapped to a centralized server to trigger the information.

# Technical Specifications / Tech Stack

- Python has been used for the development of the above detection system.
- OpenCV library has been used for image processing.
- Numpy, tflearn, dlib, facial_recognition, CMake, and tkinter are some of the modules that have been used.
- PC cam is used as video input.

# Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KavyaSwethaJ/illegal-activity-detection-system.git
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd illegal-activity-detection-system
cd src
python3 face_recognition.py
```

# Future Work / Improvements

- We can improve the frontend of the website and make it more user friendly by giving the user an option to directly interact with the database from the frontend only. 
- We can add features of the criminal behavior detection system and for the above improvement we need to perfectly train our model. 
- In future we can also be specific of which type of activity the opponent is performing.
